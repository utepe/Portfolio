        "overview": "The Wearable Biomimetic Appendage (WBA) is a soft robotic device that can mimic a user's hand and finger movements to aid in basic tasks. The device is composed of three main components: a control glove, a calibration and controller program, and a wearable robotic hand. The control glove using Hall sensors and magnets was designed for precise finger tracking, the calibration program visualized with a virtual reality (VR) environment was constructed with Unity, and the robotic hand was developed to mimic a user's movements. These achievements showcase the project's potential for diverse virtual- and real world applications.",

It was created using the Unity game engine and the Oculus Integration package. It was designed to be used with the WBA project to visualize the user's hand movements in a virtual environment in order to test and validate the control glove's calibration. It also acts as a controller for the WBA device in order to cycle between different modes of the device.",
